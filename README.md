# A Finite State Machine Solver for EngSci Students
This project was started on December 9, 2019. The goal of this program is to solve any binary Finite State Machine (FSM) by outputting the logic for the states, the corresponding circuit and the Verilog code. This program also gives the user the option of performing state minimization on the FSM.

Project Working Status: In Progress (as of December 17, 2019)
